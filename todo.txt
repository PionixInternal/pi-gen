to fix:

- include everest and update uC automatically including downgrades to make sure it fits the release version
- rw/ro into bash prompt
- make sure fsck really runs at least on boot partition from time to time?
- non default pw for everest user
- generate PIN for display
- rauc status mark-good without RW does not work but does not fail either
- real PKI
- real boot screen
- /tmp has no write permission for normal users
- watchdog
- rpi eeprom bootloader update needs to be handled somehow
sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a seems to only update if a new version is available.
Service is now disabled, so we need to run this at every update!
- default password does not work for now, needs special treatment!
- think about cloning the whole raspian repo to own server


updates:

- VL805 usb controller
- rpi eeprom boot loader
- rpi firmware on boot part
- kernel and device tree
- root partition incl everest
- yeti controller FW
