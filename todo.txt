to fix:

- include everest and update uC automatically including downgrades to make sure it fits the release version
- non default pw for everest user
- real PKI
- network time sync

------- later
- sync systemtime to RTC and back
- make sure fsck really runs at least on boot partition from time to time?
- think about cloning the whole raspian repo to own server
- watchdog - work around for now is power cycling to go back to previous image
- generate PIN for display
- better boot screen instead of just black
- rauc status mark-good without RW does not work but does not fail either

to test:
- /tmp has no write permission for normal users


updates:

- VL805 usb controller
! rpi eeprom boot loader - will not be updated as it is a single point of failure.
- rpi firmware on boot part
- kernel and device tree
- root partition incl everest
- yeti controller FW

Production:
1 update eeprom with "sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a". It does not update automatically from here, if we really have to we can roll out an update that updates.
2 flash complete image
3 boot once with cable ethernet and wait for updates to install
